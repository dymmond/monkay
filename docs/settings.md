# Settings

## Forwarding Settings

In some cases, you may have separate packages that need to operate independently but still need to use the
settings of a main package. **Monkay** allows for a forwarding mode where settings are forwarded from a child
package to the main package.

In this mode, the cache is disabled, and settings are assigned either by setting a function or by simply
assigning a callable to the `settings` property of the `Monkay` instance. The callable should return a suitable
settings object.

### Example: Child Package

```python
import os
from monkay import Monkay

monkay = Monkay(
    globals(),
    settings_path=os.environ.get("MONKAY_CHILD_SETTINGS", "foo.test:example") or ""
)
```

### Example: Main Package

```python
import os
import child

monkay = Monkay(
    globals(),
    settings_path=os.environ.get("MONKAY_MAIN_SETTINGS", "foo.test:example") or ""
)
child.monkay.settings = lambda: monkay.settings
```

With this setup, the child package will use the settings from the main package, ensuring that all configurations
are aligned.

---

## Lazy Settings Setup

With **Monkay**, settings are only evaluated when needed. This allows for lazy setup, meaning you can defer the
evaluation of settings until later in the application lifecycle.

### Example:

```python
import os
from monkay import Monkay

monkay = Monkay(
    globals(),
    # Required for initializing settings feature
    settings_path=""
)

# Lazy setup based on environment variables
if not os.environ.get("DEBUG"):
    monkay.settings = os.environ.get("MONKAY_MAIN_SETTINGS", "foo.test:example") or ""
elif os.environ.get("PERFORMANCE"):
    monkay.settings = DebugSettings
else:
    monkay.settings = DebugSettings()

# Now the settings are applied
monkay.evaluate_settings()
```

This approach allows for flexible configuration of the application, based on the environment, while deferring the
actual evaluation of settings.

---

## Multi-Stage Settings Setup

For situations where you need to load settings from multiple sources or paths, **Monkay** supports multi-stage
settings evaluation. By passing `ignore_import_errors=True`, you can attempt to load settings from multiple paths
and handle errors more gracefully.

### Example:

```python
import os
from monkay import Monkay

monkay = Monkay(
    globals(),
    # Required for initializing settings feature
    settings_path=""
)

def find_settings():
    for path in ["a.settings", "b.settings.develop"]:
        if monkay.evaluate_settings(ignore_import_errors=True):
            break
```

In this example, **Monkay** tries to evaluate settings from both `a.settings` and `b.settings.develop`, ignoring
import errors if they occur.

---

## `evaluate_settings` Method

The `evaluate_settings` method is used to explicitly evaluate the settings, regardless of whether they have been
evaluated already. It also allows you to control how conflicts and import errors are handled.

### Parameters:
- `on_conflict`: Controls the behavior when settings conflict. Defaults to `error`.
- `onetime`: If `True` (default), the settings are evaluated only on the first call. Subsequent calls are no-ops.
- `ignore_import_errors`: If `True`, suppresses import-related errors when loading settings. Defaults to `False`.
- `ignore_preload_import_errors`: If `True`, suppresses errors related to preloads in settings. Defaults to `True`.

### Example:

```python
monkay.evaluate_settings(on_conflict="warn", ignore_import_errors=True)
```

This method will return `True` if the settings were successfully evaluated, or `False` if there was an error.

> **Note**: `evaluate_settings` does not touch the settings if no `settings_preloads_name` or `settings_extensions_name` is set, but it will still set the `settings_evaluated` flag to `True`.

> **Note**: The `ignore_import_errors` flag also suppresses the `UnsetError` that occurs when settings are unset.

---

## `settings_evaluated` Flag

The `settings_evaluated` flag is an internal property that tracks whether the settings have been evaluated.
This flag can be set on the `ContextVar` or on the instance, depending on the context.

It is reset when new settings are assigned and is initially set to `False` for instances without settings.

---

## Other Settings Types

**Monkay** supports various ways of assigning settings:

- **String or Class**: Initialization happens the first time the settings are accessed and are cached afterward.
- **Function**: The function gets evaluated each time the settings are accessed. If caching is required,
- it is up to the function to handle it (e.g., forwarding settings can rely on caching in the main settings).

You can also use the `settings_path` parameter to assign a settings location directly, using either a string or
class reference.

### Caching Behavior:
- **String or Class**: These types are cached after the first evaluation.
- **Function**: Functions are re-evaluated on every access. If needed, the caching mechanism can be handled within
the function (e.g., caching results in the main settings).

---

## Forwarder

Sometimes, you may need to forward old settings to the **Monkay** settings. While there isnâ€™t a built-in helper,
creating a forwarder is easy. Here's an example:

```python
from typing import Any, cast, TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .global_settings import EdgySettings

class SettingsForward:
    def __getattribute__(self, name: str) -> Any:
        import edgy
        return getattr(edgy.monkay.settings, name)

# Pretend the forward is the real object
settings = cast("EdgySettings", SettingsForward())

__all__ = ["settings"]
```

### Note:
If you want to enable setting modifications, you may also need to define `__setattr__` and `__delattr__`.
However, this is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.

---

## Deleting Settings

You can delete settings by assigning one of the following values: `""`, `None`, or `False`. Afterward, any access
to settings will raise an error until new settings are assigned.

Example:

```python
monkay.settings = None  # This will delete the current settings
```

Trying to access `monkay.settings` afterward will raise an error until settings are set again.

---

## Settings Preloads and Extensions

**Monkay** allows you to handle settings preloads and extensions. Preloads are used to initialize settings before
other components of the application, and extensions can be used to add extra functionality.

### Example: Preloading Settings

```python
monkay.settings_preloads_name = "preload_settings"
monkay.evaluate_settings()
```

This ensures that `preload_settings` are loaded before the application starts, providing a mechanism to set up
necessary configurations upfront.

### Example: Adding Extensions

```python
monkay.settings_extensions_name = "additional_settings_extension"
monkay.evaluate_settings()
```

Extensions allow you to modify or extend the configuration system, adding custom behavior as needed.

---

## Handling Settings Conflicts

If multiple sources of settings are evaluated, conflicts may arise. By setting the `on_conflict` parameter, you can control how conflicts are handled.

### Conflict Options:
- `error`: Raise an error when a conflict occurs (default).
- `warn`: Log a warning but continue processing.
- `merge`: Merge the conflicting settings.
