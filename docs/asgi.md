# ASGI

Given that monkay is used from a bunch of libraries which hook into ASGI lifespans,
we have also some ASGI helpers.

## `lifespan`

Wraps an asgi application as AsyncContextManager and run the lifespan protocol. You can optionally provide an `timeout` parameter.
This can be handy for spurious hangups when used for testing.

```python
{!> ../docs_src/lifespan/lifespan.py !}
```

## `LifespanProvider` (Experimental)

For the use with asgi servers which does not implement the lifespan protocol. Here we just hook into the eventloop and bring lifespan to the ASGI app.

When the asgi server supports lifespans, the `LifespanProvider` doesn't inject its own lifespan task. This can be helpful when relying on lifespans but supporting servers like daphne.

```python
{!> ../docs_src/lifespan/LifespanProvider.py !}
```

!!! Warning
    `LifespanProvider` is experimental. You may can experience hangs. It should however work with one thread per worker.
    I couldn't rule out hangs in my tests.

## `LifespanHook`

You have a library with setup/shutdown routines and want to integrate it with lifespan in an ASGI webserver?
Or you have django, ... which still doesn't support lifespan?

This middleware is your life-saver.

For hooking simply provide a setup async callable which returns an AsyncExitStack (contextlib) for cleaning up. That simple.
LifespanHook has an endpoint mode, so that lifespan events are not forwarded.
This is required for e.g. django, which still doesn't support lifespans.


Examples:

**Example library integration**
```python
{!> ../docs_src/lifespan/LifespanHook.py !}
```

**Example django**

Django hasn't lifespan support yet. To use it with lifespan servers (and middleware) we can do something like this:
```python
{!> ../docs_src/lifespan/LifespanHookDjango.py !}
```


**Example testing**
```python
{!> ../docs_src/lifespan/LifespanHookTesting.py !}
```


## Forwarded attributes feature of LifespanProvider and LifespanHook

Access on attributes which doesn't exist on `LifespanProvider` and `LifespanHook` are forwarded to the wrapped app (callable which can also be something like an Lilya or Esmerald instance). This allows users to access methods on it without unwrapping. Setting and deleting however doesn't work this way.
To unwrap to the native instance use the `__wrapped__` attribute.


The yielded app of `lifespan` is not wrapped
